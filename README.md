## FREE CODE CAMP PROJECT: TWITCH API

### Project Objective:
Use the Twitchtv JSON API to build a page similar to this [page](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo).

### Project User Stories:

- As a user, I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
- As a user, I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.
- As a user, if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.

### My Work:
I chose to go off script as a way to challenge myself and do more with the data that is available on the Twitch API.
I opted to build a streaming site that shows (mostly) English-only top live streams and top clips from the 
top 50 trending games on Twitch at any given moment. The site is great for discovering new channels. Completing this
project helped me get very comfortable at working with API data and handling client-side event logics using Vanilla JS; 
it greatly helped me gain a solid working knowledge of DOM manipulation.
